#  AI Powered Predictive Maintenance System

## Introduction
The AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance System is a smart monitoring solution that uses machine learning to predict industrial equipment failures before they happen. By analyzing historical sensor data, the system provides real-time insights and helps businesses reduce downtime, optimize maintenance schedules, and improve operational efficiency.
## Features
1. **Home:** Welcome page providing an overview of the application.
2. **Historical Data:** View historical data of machinery sensor readings and operational hours.
3. **Input Data:** Submit input data for prediction, either manually or by generating random values.
4. **Results:** Display predictions for remaining useful life (RUL), maintenance status, and anomaly detection based on the input data.
5. **Visualizations:** Visualize historical sensor data and operational hours through histograms, scatter plots, and line charts. Optionally overlay generated input values on visualizations.

## Technologies Used
- **🚀 Streamlit →:** Build interactive and user-friendly web applications with ease.
- **📊 Pandas →:** Powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
- **🔢 NumPy →:** Efficient numerical computing for large datasets
- **📈 Matplotlib →:** Create stunning static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **🎨 Seaborn →:** Enhance statistical graphics with beautiful and informative plots.
- **🤖 scikit-learn →:** Robust machine learning library for predictive modeling and analysis.
- **🌍 GitHub →:** Collaborate and manage code efficiently with version control.
